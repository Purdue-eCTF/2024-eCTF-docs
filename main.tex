% \jw{In \texttt{main.tex}, uncomment \texttt{\textbackslash longtrue} to make it a private copy (with additional details and comments we don't share with other teams) or \texttt{\textbackslash longfalse} to make it a public copy (with comments removed)}

% \jw{For each section or LaTeX figure, use a new file to make collaboration less annoying. e.g. see \texttt{intro.tex} for introduction}

% \hl{This is also a comment. Delete all highlighted comments before sending to organizers!!!}
